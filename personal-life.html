    <h2>Places I Have Lived</h2>
    <p> 
 I've been lucky enough to live in a few different countries. 
    </p> 
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 0;">
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">🇮🇷 Iran – So, I grew up in Mashhad, this city in the eastern part of Iran, and hung out there for like 14 years. I also spent a year and a half in Tehran, the capital, and another six years in Shahroud, which is this really charming small town.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">🇯🇵 Japan – I was in Japan for about 9 months when I was just a 1-year-old, tagging along with my family. I have some adorable pics of me dressed up in Japanese outfits!</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">🇦🇺 Australia – Australia might just top my list of faves for its awesome vibes, cool people, and culture! I spent 6 months there in year 10, went to Kingswood Highschool in Penrith, a suburb of Sydney. Totally picked up the Australian accent while I was there, though it's pretty much gone now. Hit up Brisbane, Melbourne, Canberra, and did loads of sightseeing in Sydney too.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">🇨🇭 Switzerland – Spent four awesome months in Lausanne from July to October in 2022. Ended up making friends from over 20 different countries! Did a bunch of hiking and checked out loads of gorgeous Swiss cities like Geneva, Zermatt, Kinderstagen, Zurich, Neuchâtel, etc. Also went around Europe a bit e.g. Austria, Italy and Germany. Totally would choose Switzerland for my honeymoon, no doubt about it.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">🇩🇪 Germany – I lived in Bochum for 6 months from July to December 2023. It was a pretty chill time, mostly sticking to indoor stuff like hitting the gym and swimming. Totally obsessed with Unifit back then – that place was my paradise. Also took some trips to Paris, Munich, and Switzerland (again), plus hit up nearby cities like Dortmund, Düsseldorf, and Cologne while I was there.</li>
</ul>

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p> 
        Chatting about the stuff I love to do, let's kick off with the active stuff like swimming, hiking, hitting the gym, bouldering, running, and now and then, gliding around on ice skates. Back in the day, I used to swim competitively, but now I'm all about that relaxed swim life. Though, I gotta say, I still daydream about smashing the 100m butterfly in less than a minute.
<br><br>
Then, when it comes to kicking back and watching sports, I'm all in for FC Bayern Munich since 2018. I've got a bit of a fan thing going for Manuel Neuer. And yeah, I'll catch a swimming event here and there, especially those national medley relays – they're just too cool.

    <h2>Favourite Shows</h2>
    <p> 
As for my go-to TV shows, picking favorites is tough 'cause there's just so much good stuff. But, for sure, these make the list:
    </p> 
<ul style="list-style-type: disc; margin-left: 0;">
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">24 – Caught this when I was just 12, and it's all about Jack Bauer being a total hero for his country. Though, I've got to be honest, I'm not cool with how it kinda throws shade at Muslims, Russians, and Chinese. Still love it, though.</li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Modern Family – The humour in this show really has its own unique and distinct flavour. </li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">How I Met Your Mother – Well Barney Stinson is not something I wanna miss. </li>
  <li style="margin-left: 20px;">Gilmore Girls – Never got to live through the '90s and '00s, but something about those times feels just right. Watching this show kinda takes me back, and it's hard to put into words how awesome that feels.</li>
</ul>
